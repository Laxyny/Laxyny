### Hi there 👋

**Welcome to my github page.**
I am Laxyny, a young French passionate about development, I try to diversify using several platforms (android, ios, Windows, Linux...) but also different programming languages (Dart, JavaScript, HTML...).

I am not yet a developer but I will make sure to become one!
